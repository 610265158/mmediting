# Getting Started

This page provides basic tutorials about the usage of MMEditing.
For installation instructions, please see [install.md](install.md).

## Prepare datasets

It is recommended to symlink the dataset root to `$MMEditing/data`.
If your folder structure is different, you may need to change the corresponding paths in config files.

[Matting](datasets_matting.md)

[Restoration](datasets_restoration.md)

[Generation](datasets_generation.md)

## Inference with pretrained models

We provide testing scripts to evaluate a whole dataset (COCO, PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes, etc.),
and also some high-level apis for easier integration to other projects.
