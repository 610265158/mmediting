# MMEditing: Image and Video Editing Toolbox

## Introduction

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3 to 1.5**.

MMEditing is an open source editing toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the OpenMMLab project developed by [Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).


### Major features

- **Modular design**

  We decompose the editing framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized editor framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple tasks in editing**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary *inpainting*, *matting*, *super-resolution* ang *generation* tasks.

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox provides state-of-the-art methods in inpainting/matting/super-resolution/generation.
